## What is Mission of Mercy?

While there are other Missions of Mercy around the country, the mission this project supports is a one or two-day clinic in which portable dental stations are set up in a large public arena and dental screenings and services are provided at no charge to those who attend. Historically, demand for these clinics has been so intense that individuals often stand in line, as early as midnight, to receive the services. In the USA half of the states run Mission of Mercy clinics.

It's easy to work on a software project and never see the impact it makes on people. For Mission of Mercy, it's hard NOT to see the amazing impact your contributions make on people's lives. Below is a collection of photos and videos from various clinics throughout the country which use this software.

## Authorship

Mission of Mercy was originally written by Jordan Byron for the 2009 Connecticut Mission of Mercy dental clinic. During the 2008 CT clinic, Jordan's then employer, Integrity Systems & Solutions, saw areas of the clinic which could benefit from custom software written to fit the flow and "Mash Unit" environment of the clinic. Together, Jordan and his colleagues designed the first version of the clinic software.

Over the years many people have contributed to Mission of Mercy through writing patches, performing QA tests, and helping out with the design. Without the help of Christopher Mitchell and Josephine Bicknell this project would not exist.
